## History

I first encountered shell archive files in the 90s and I always found it odd that they couldn't handle'
binary files even though uuencode existed.  So, this just scratched and itch I always had.  No one
uses shell archive files so this is just me being silly.

## Installation

This is written on OpenBSD so just 'make install' as root and it will go right in.
