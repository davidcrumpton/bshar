.Sh NAME
.Nm bshar
.Nd create a binary compatible shell archive of files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bshar
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm bshar
writes an
.Xr sh 1
shell script to the standard output which will recreate the file
hierarchy specified by the command line operands. It can include
binary files unlike the
.Xr shar 1 
command. Directories will be recreated and must be specified before the
files they contain (the
.Xr find 1
utility does this correctly).
.Pp
.Nm bshar
is normally used for distributing files by
.Xr ftp 1
or
.Xr mail 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
To create a shell archive of the program
.Xr ls 1
and mail it to Rick:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ cd ls
$ bshar `find . -print` | mail -s "ls source" rick
.Ed
.Pp
To recreate the program directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ mkdir ls
$ cd ls
\&...
<delete header lines and examine mailed archive>
\&...
$ sh archive
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr compress 1 ,
.Xr mail 1 ,
.Xr tar 1 ,
.Xr vis 1 ,
.Xr unvis 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command originally appeared in
.Bx 4.4 
as 
.Xr shar 1
which didn't handle binary files.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm bshar
archives are portable to systems with the 
.Xr unvis 1
program installed.
.Xr vis 1
is needed to make the shar arvhive.
.Pp
It is easy to insert trojan horses into
.Nm bshar
files.
It is strongly recommended that all shell archive files be examined
before running them through
.Xr sh 1 .
Archives produced using this implementation of
.Nm bshar
may be easily examined with the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ egrep -v '^[X#]' bshar.file
.Ed
